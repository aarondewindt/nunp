# NUNP: Nom Universal Number Parser

Nom based combinatorial parser for parsing numbers. The goal of 
this project is to develop a parser that's able to parse as many
number representations as unicode allows. So this would include
the usual Western Hindu-Arabic numerals (integer, floats, hex, binary, 
scientific, etc), but also numerals from modern and ancient languages. 
(Eg, Chinese, Arabic, Roman, Mayan, etc).

This project is in the literature study phase. A complete list of
numerals and their definitions are needed.
